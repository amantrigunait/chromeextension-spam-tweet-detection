# TensorFlow.js Deployment Example : Browser Extension

This example creates a Chrome extension (v3), enabling users to right-click on
images within a web page, and perform multi-class object detection on them. The
extension will apply a MobileNetV2 classifier to the image, and then print
the predicted class on top of the image.

To build the extension, use the command:

```sh
yarn
yarn build
```
